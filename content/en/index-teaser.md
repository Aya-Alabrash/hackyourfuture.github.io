Together with our awesome female teachers and students we organise a women coding workshop every two months to get more women excited about coding, and hopefully join our HackYourFuture community.

In three hours we will give an impression about what it means to be a developer. We will talk about job opportunities in the technology sector and most importantly we will do some hands-on coding and you will build your first website.
